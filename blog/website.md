### 🔄 The Challenge: Dynamic Layout vs. Memory Anchoring

One of the biggest hurdles right now involves using **D3.js** to visualize and organize bookmarks. While force-directed layouts are visually compelling and self-organizing, they come with a major drawback:

> 🔁 **They don’t maintain a consistent layout between renders.**

This is more than a technical quirk—it's a **user experience concern**. Humans rely on **spatial memory**. When something is placed in a spot, we expect it to **stay there**. Our brains create mental maps of information, and when those maps shift unexpectedly, it creates dissonance.

Balancing these two opposing needs is proving to be a key design challenge:

- ✅ **We want automatic organization** — things should flow and adapt as the dataset changes.
- 🧭 **We need spatial consistency** — users must feel grounded and able to return to familiar places.

How do we allow the layout to evolve **without disorienting the user**?

This remains an active design problem, and one of the core philosophical questions for the plugin’s interaction model.

Stay tuned.
