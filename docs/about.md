### 🚩 The Problem: Bookmark Overload

Bookmarks have been broken for years. It's incredibly easy to create them, but managing, organizing, or deleting them? That’s a different story. Over time, this leads to:

- **Bookmark debt** – endless folders and links you'll never revisit
- **Digital fatigue** – cluttered menus and no mental clarity
- **Privacy concerns** – cloud-sync and AI-powered bookmark tools often compromise user privacy
