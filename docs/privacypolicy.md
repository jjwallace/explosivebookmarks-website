# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: May 31, 2025**

Thank you for using **ExplosiveBookmarks** ("we", "us", or "our"). This browser extension is designed to enhance your online experience by rendering interactive content on webpages and providing visual access to your bookmarks in a more intuitive format. Your privacy is critically important to us, and we are committed to handling your personal information with care and transparency.

## 1. Information We Access

**ExplosiveBookmarks** requires certain permissions to function as intended. These include:

- **Bookmarks Access**: We access your browser’s bookmarks to display and organize them in a visual and interactive way. This access is read-only and happens entirely within your browser environment. We do **not** store or transmit your bookmarks to any external servers.

- **Webpage Content (Rendering Overlays)**: In order to render content on the page, the extension may read or interact with elements of the currently viewed website. This is used to properly position and display the visual components of ExplosiveBookmarks (e.g., overlays, animations). This content is never stored, analyzed, or sent elsewhere.

> At no point do we collect personally identifiable information such as your browsing history, passwords, form inputs, or cookies.

---

## 2. How We Use This Information

The information ExplosiveBookmarks accesses is used solely to provide the core functionality of the extension, including:

- Displaying bookmarks as interactive visual elements on webpages.
- Enhancing the user interface with overlays, animations, or effects based on your current page.
- Allowing you to navigate, manage, or explore your bookmarks more effectively.

All data access is strictly local to your browser and used only in real time to power these features.

## 3. Data Storage and Transmission

**ExplosiveBookmarks does not collect, log, store, or transmit** any personal or non-personal data to our servers or any third-party servers. All data remains on your device and is used exclusively for the purposes of providing the extension’s functionality.

We respect your privacy. That means:

- ✅ We **do not sell** your data.

We have no business model based on user data monetization. Our extension is designed with privacy in mind from the ground up.
